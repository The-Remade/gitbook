### Q & A

**Q1ï¼šREDEEM redemption process suggested to improve**

A1ï¼š

1. Open a channel to collect everyone's suggestions for improvement
2. On the exchange page, put the size chart on it, and you can see it at a glance
3. Online shipping progress query, there is no online action yet, and a data query system is already being written

**Q2ï¼šWhen is the next AMA?**

A2ï¼šExpected to receive shoes in mid-August

**Q3ï¼šWhat is the current shipping progress? Are you willing to provide your ID number for shipment in the future?**

A3: Because of the relationship between the card and EZWAY, it is currently expected that everyone will receive it around mid-August. Statistical results: Everyone is reluctant to provide the ID number, 8 votes in favor, 10 votes against, so it is tentatively decided that in the future, the principle of not collecting the ID number will be adopted, and the shipment will be shipped in a centralized warehouse in Taiwan and then forwarded.

**Q4ï¼šWhen is the next offline meetup?**

A4ï¼šThe founder is also continuing to promote THE REMADE in the United States, so the next offline gathering should be hosted by Dabao, and the time is to be discussed

**Q5ï¼šCan the founder share gadgets for protecting shoes and cleaning? (shoebox or cleaner, etc.)**

A5ï¼šI will ask the founders to share more, if you have a good method, you can also share more

**Q6ï¼šWhen will the shoes for the next season start?**

A6: The shoes of the next season are expected to be designed in August. If you have any special IDEA, you can propose them, and you may have the opportunity to select styles from them to make shoes.
