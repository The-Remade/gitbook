Blockchain startup RE:DREAMER has created an "NFT redemption protocol" that can integrate NFTs with retailers' existing systems, similar to integrating PayPal on a website without changing the workflow. The goal is to package new Web3 concepts in a familiar Web2 way.&#x20;

DMKTZ has 8 years of experience in digital fashion technology and has created a platform that allows anyone, regardless of their 3D or design background, to easily design a fully 3D-modeled garment. These garments can not only be worn on 3D NFTs, but also have the potential to be manufactured as physical garments using DMKTZ's cutting-edge production techniques, making fashion truly sustainable and customizable.

LABLACO platform was founded in 2016 with the aim of combining circular fashion and technology to prolong the lifespan of clothing and help brands connect with consumers more easily through new technologies. Users can upload unwanted clothes to the platform, and if other users want them, they only need to pay for shipping to obtain them, similar to a secondhand exchange. If users donate items on the platform, they can earn LABLACO currency, which can be used to purchase fashion items on the platform. In addition, large brands can also upgrade and upcycle unsold items, while fashion industry professionals and KOLs can share excess clothing on the platform, which uses technology to enable more ways of circulating products.
